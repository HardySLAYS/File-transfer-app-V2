# File-transfer-app-V2
A remote file transfer application created using UNIX sockets in C++.

## Intro
 This application has basically the same functionalities of the previous version, I just uploaded this as a separate repo instead of a newer version for the sole reason that the source code of this application varies gratly from the previous version. You can see the instructions as well as the installation and working of the project from the previous repo linked [here](https://github.com/HardySLAYS/FILE-TRANSFER-OVER-LAN-USING-SOCKETS).
 
 The difference in this version, as I mentioned, is that of the structure of source code. The source code written for this project is very modular and easy to understand, if you know even the basics of socket programming in C++.
 
 That's all for this time folks, sayonara.
